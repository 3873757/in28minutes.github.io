## What is Object Relational Impedence Mismatch

Java is an object oriented programming language. In Java, all data is stored in objects.

Typically, Relational databases are used to store data (These days, a number of other NoSQL data stores are also becoming popular - We will stay away from them, for now).  Relational databases store data in tables.

The way we design objects is different from the way the relational databases are designed. This results in an impedence mismatch.
 - Object Oriented programming consists of concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces and polymorphism 
 - Relational databases are made up of Tables with concepts like normalization 

### Examples of Object Relational Impedence Mismatch

Lets consider a simple example - Employees and Tasks.

Each Employee can have multiple Tasks. Each Task can be shared by multiple Employees. There is a Many to Many relationship between them. Let's consider a few examples of impedence mismatch.

#### Example 1 : Task table below is mapped to Task Table. However, there are mismatches in column names.

```java
public class Task {
	private int id;

	private String desc;

	private Date targetDate;

	private boolean isDone;

	private List<Employee> employees;
}
```

```sql
 CREATE TABLE task 
  ( 
     id          INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY, 
     description VARCHAR(255), 
     is_done     BOOLEAN, 
     target_date TIMESTAMP, 
     PRIMARY KEY (id) 
  ) 
```

#### Example 2 : Relationships between objects are expressed in a different way compared with relationship between tables.

Each Employee can have multiple Tasks. Each Task can be shared by multiple Employees. There is a Many to Many relationship between them.

```java
public class Employee {
   
     //Some other code
	
	@ManyToMany
	private List<Task> tasks;
}

public class Task {

     //Some other code

	private List<Employee> employees;
}
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee 
  ( 
     id            BIGINT NOT NULL, 
     OTHER_COLUMNS
  ) 


  CREATE TABLE employee_tasks 
  ( 
     employees_id BIGINT NOT NULL, 
     tasks_id     INTEGER NOT NULL 
  ) 

  CREATE TABLE task 
  ( 
     id          INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY, 
     OTHER_COLUMNS
  ) 

```

#### Example 3 : Some times multiple classes are mapped to a single table and viceversa

```java
public  class Employee {	
    //Other Employee Attributes
}

public class FullTimeEmployee extends Employee {
	protected Integer salary;
}

public class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee {
	protected Float hourlyWage;
}
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee 
  ( 
     employee_type VARCHAR(31) NOT NULL, 
     id            BIGINT NOT NULL, 
     city          VARCHAR(255), 
     state         VARCHAR(255), 
     street        VARCHAR(255), 
     zip           VARCHAR(255), 

     hourly_wage   FLOAT,  --PartTimeEmployee

     salary        INTEGER, --FullTimeEmployee

     PRIMARY KEY (id) 
  ) 

```
